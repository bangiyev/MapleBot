# MapleBot

## Instructions

Press F5 to start/pause. If paused, pressing start will continue right where it was left off.
Run the bot alongside notificationSystem.exe to enable the following alerts:
  - Other players (friend, guild member, stranger) enter your map
  - Elite boss spawned
  - Rune spawned
  - Lie Detector

## Warnings

- Use windowed mode.
- Minimap should be open at all times. The bot tracks your yellow dot to determine map positioning
- Skill tray should be open and have all relevant skills mapped on there for visible cooldowns
- For best results detecting LDs, turn off background in game versions that support it
